            IR Photos of Little Wild Horse Canyon

                Little Wild Horse is a classic slot canyon located in south-central Utah, near Goblin Valley. 
                It is a popular hiking spot for families and youth groups. The main attraction is a long stretch 
                of "narrows," where the canyon walls are so close you have to turn sideways to get through. The 
                rock walls are sculpted and very beautiful.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                There are two popular approaches to hiking here. Some people simply go into Little Wild Horse, 
                hike as far as they feel comfortable and then return the way they came in. More adventurous people
                make a loop by hiking up Little Wild Horse and then crossing over and descending Bell Canyon. The loop 
                hike totals about 8 miles, and is moderately strenuous.

                These canyons are normally dry, although they may harbor pools of water during the spring and immediately
                after summer storms. If there are pools, hikers just wade through them - the water is usually only ankle-deep.
                Flash floods pose a risk to people hiking narrow canyons. Never enter a slot canyon if there is a significant
                chance of rain anywhere in the canyon's drainage area.

            Infrared photography is a look into the invisible world. The human eye can see wavelengths from about 400nm-700nm
            (from purple to red); infrared is the light beyond 700nm. IR photography can be done with either infrared film, or
            a digital camera, and typically involves near infrared light in the 700nm to 1200nm range.

            Salmon Run Porcupine Reservoir

            The Kokanee Salmon are running in the rivers. We went to see them in the Fall this year and it was truly amazing.
            Here is a photo if you’re interested in seeing the bright red salmon. The Kokanee Salmon Run in Utah is a quick event
            , and only lasts a few weeks, so don’t miss it next year. You can usually see the salmon from mid to late September.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>
            Also, please don’t touch or catch the fish. This is disruptive to the salmon and their life cycle. Remember to always 
            leave no trace when out adventuring, which means to leave nature alone as if you weren’t there. So look and enjoy, but
            don’t bother the fish.

        Twin Falls Mishap an Amazing adventure

        we tried to go to Twin Falls to check out Shoshone Falls. We actually were told at
        the campsite that the balls were under maintenance and that it wasn't worth going 
        and seeing that falls we were set on a journey all over the small area of Twin Falls
         to see some beautiful waterfalls that nobody goes and sees
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
        Had a blast with the wife and kids! I am blessed with the simpler things in life. 
        Big thanks to Karen (for saying... go check out Twin Falls area.... they got an 
        alligator at the hot springs ) and to the camp host at Rustic Edge RV Park for sending
        us to the waterfall and other cool places. And a Super Big Thank You to my wife (Ivonne) 
        for planning all of this.
